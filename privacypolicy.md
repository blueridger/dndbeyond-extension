Privacy Policy for DnD Beyond Auto Source Filter browser extension

Google is making me write this. The extension does not transmit or store any data to parties beyond yourself and dndbeyond.com. It simply stores the current and saved source filter in the `storage.sync` data store provided by your browser, and then gives that filter back to dndbeyond.com in the form of url query params.
